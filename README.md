# Recreating Bootstrap Dropdown

Your assignment is write the CSS and JavaScript required to mimic
a minimal example of Bootstrap's dropdown.

Links to Bootstrap's CSS/JS are included in `index.html` so you can
see how the page should look.

Comment out the Bootstrap links and add the necessary CSS/JS to
`dropdown.css` and `dropdown.js` to get to work :smile:.

# Requirements

-   Clicking a dropdown's button should show the dropdown menu
    beneath the button.
-   Clicking it again should hide the dropdown menu.
-   The dropdown menu should appear on top of content that is
    beneath the dropdown button (it shouldn't push the other
    content down).
